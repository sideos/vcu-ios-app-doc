# Integration guide

For developers of **issuers** and **verifiers** who want the iPhone wallet to work with their service. The platform side is the same as for the [browser wallet](https://sideos.github.io/vcu-browser-wallet-doc/integration/browser.html): the same API key, the same `POST /api/credentials/offers` and `POST /api/presentations/requests` calls, the same verification result. What differs is how the wallet is reached: **links and QR codes** instead of page attributes, and **Safari's Digital Credentials API for mdoc only**.

The app is distributed through TestFlight (iOS 26 and later) and holds both formats, `dc+sd-jwt` and `mso_mdoc`. These notes describe **build {{ site.wallet_build }}**.

## At a glance

| You want to | Do this |
|---|---|
| Issue, same device | A link whose `href` is the `credentialOffer` URI (`openid-credential-offer://…`) |
| Issue, other device | The same URI as a QR code |
| Issue after a login at your issuer | The user pastes your issuer URL into the wallet |
| Request, same device | A link whose `href` is the `authorizationRequest` (`openid4vp://…`) |
| Request, other device | The same URI as a QR code |
| Request from a web page, standard API | Digital Credentials API in Safari, `org-iso-mdoc`, mdoc only |

## Issuing a credential

Create the offer as in [Flow 1 of the browser guide](https://sideos.github.io/vcu-browser-wallet-doc/integration/browser.html#flow-1-issuing-a-credential), then hand the `credentialOffer` URI to the phone:

```html
<!-- same device: a plain link; iOS opens the wallet for this scheme -->
<a href="openid-credential-offer://?credential_offer=…">Add to VCu Wallet</a>
```

- **Other device:** render the same URI as a QR code. The user scans it in the wallet (Home → **Scan QR code**).
- **Transaction code:** if the offer requires a `tx_code`, the wallet asks for it and shows your `tx_code.description` as the hint. Send the code by another channel (SMS, email).
- **Expiry and single use:** offers are single use and expire (10 minutes on the sandbox). Create the offer when the user is ready, not when the page loads.
- **Sign-in issuance (authorization code):** give the user your issuer identifier, `https://<platform>/oid4vci/<orgId>`. They paste it into the wallet, pick the credential type, and sign in on your login page in a private browser sheet. The sign-in must finish within 5 minutes. Nothing to render on your side. End users must exist in your organisation.
- **Key attestation:** if your template sets `keyAttestationRequired`, the wallet accepts it only for `key_storage: ["none"]`, backed by Apple App Attest. It declines anything that names an ISO 18045 level or `user_authentication`, before using the offer up.

The result on your side is as in the browser flow: the credential is issued, and the notification endpoint reports `credential_accepted`, `credential_deleted` (declined) or `credential_failure`.

## Requesting and verifying a presentation

### By link or QR code (OpenID4VP)

Create the request as in [Flow 2 of the browser guide](https://sideos.github.io/vcu-browser-wallet-doc/integration/browser.html#flow-2-requesting-and-verifying-a-presentation), then hand the `authorizationRequest` to the phone the same way as an offer:

```html
<a href="openid4vp://?client_id=…&request_uri=…">Share from VCu Wallet</a>
```

or as a QR code for another device. Then poll `GET /api/presentations/requests/{id}` from your backend, exactly as in the browser flow.

- **Signed requests show who you are.** With `trustModel: "rpac"`, the wallet verifies your access certificate and shows your organisation as a **verified relying party**, including your `organizationIdentifier`, and your registration certificate as verified when you have one. Unsigned requests work, but the user sees a warning. Users can turn on a setting that refuses every request not signed with an access certificate.
- **Encryption:** `jarm: true` (`direct_post.jwt`) is supported; the user sees "Response is encrypted to the verifier".
- **Both formats:** DCQL queries for `dc+sd-jwt` and `mso_mdoc` work, as do `credential_sets` and `transaction_data` (TS12 payment, login, account access) on `dc+sd-jwt`. See [Approving a payment]({% link user-guide/sharing.md %}#approving-a-payment) for what the user sees.
- **Returning to your page.** If your response endpoint answers the wallet's post with `{"redirect_uri": "https://…"}` (OpenID4VP 1.0 §8.2), the wallet opens it after Share or Decline. That URL can also use your own app's scheme. Without one, the wallet tells the user the data was sent and to go back by hand. The VCu platform doesn't return a `redirect_uri` yet (requested), so for now your page notices the result by polling.
- **Decline** posts `error=access_denied` (with your `state`) to your response endpoint.

### From a web page in Safari (Digital Credentials API)

Safari offers third-party wallets the `org-iso-mdoc` protocol only (ISO/IEC 18013-7 Annex C). OpenID4VP over the DC API isn't available to them on iOS, so SD-JWT credentials can't be requested this way: use a link or QR code for those.

1. **Create the request** with your page's exact origin and the mdoc protocol:

   ```json
   POST /api/presentations/requests
   {
     "templateId": "…",
     "format": "mso_mdoc",
     "requestedClaims": ["family_name", "age_over_18"],
     "dcApiOrigin": "https://shop.example.com",
     "dcApiProtocols": ["org-iso-mdoc"],
     "trustModel": "rpac"
   }
   ```

   `trustModel: "rpac"` signs the request (reader authentication); leave it out for an unsigned request. The response carries `digitalCredentialRequests`, an array of `{ protocol, data }`.

2. **Call the browser API** from a click handler:

   ```js
   const credential = await navigator.credentials.get({
     mediation: 'required',
     digital: { requests: digitalCredentialRequests },
   });
   ```

   iOS shows its own wallet picker, then the VCu Wallet sheet.

3. **Forward the answer** from your backend: `POST /api/presentations/requests/{id}/response` with `{ "protocol": credential.protocol, "response": credential.data.response }`. The reply is the final status. The response is HPKE-encrypted to the request's key, so your page only ever holds ciphertext.

What to expect:

- **The wallet is offered only when it can answer.** iOS lists VCu Wallet only if the wallet holds a document of the requested docType, and only if the user allowed websites to see which documents it holds.
- **Bound to your origin**, as reported by Safari. A response forwarded from another origin fails verification.
- **Decline** rejects the promise. Handle a rejection as "not shared".

## Current limitations

- **No wallet-presence signal.** Your page can't tell whether the app is installed. If it isn't, an `openid-credential-offer://` or `openid4vp://` link does nothing, or opens another wallet that claims the same scheme. iOS doesn't define which app wins when several claim one scheme.
- **No universal links yet.** Only the two custom schemes are registered.
- **No redirect from the VCu platform yet** (see above).
- **One flow at a time.** A second link while the wallet is busy is ignored.
- **Sandbox trust only.** The app trusts the VCu sandbox's issuer root, access CA root and registrar root. Requests and credentials under other roots are marked unverified.
- **Simulator.** Secure Enclave keys and the Safari document provider need a physical iPhone.
